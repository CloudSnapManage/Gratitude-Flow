## üìÇ Project Structure

The project follows the standard Next.js App Router structure with some logical organization for maintainability:

-   `src/app/`: Contains all the routes, layouts, and pages.
    -   `src/app/(app)`: Authenticated/main application routes.
    -   `src/app/(auth)`: Login and signup routes.
-   `src/components/`: Shared and reusable React components.
    -   `src/components/ui`: UI components from ShadCN.
    -   `src/components/auth`: Authentication-related components.
    -   `src/components/layout`: Layout components like the header.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions, Firebase configuration, and constants.
-   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `use-toast`).
-   `src/ai/`: Configuration and flows for Genkit (for AI functionality).

## üíæ Data Management

Your privacy is paramount. All journal entries are stored directly in your browser's **local storage**. This means your data stays on your device and is not sent to any server.

-   **Export:** You can back up your data at any time from the **Settings** page. This will generate a `gratitudeflow-backup.json` file.
-   **Import:** You can restore your journal from a backup file on the same page. **Note:** Importing will overwrite any existing entries in your browser.
